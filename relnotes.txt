ANNOUNCING Bitmask, the internet encryption toolkit, v0.3.0

The LEAP team is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
version 0.3.0 of Bitmask

https://downloads.leap.se/client/

LEAP (LEAP Encryption Access Project) develops a plan to secure
everyday communication, breaking down into discrete services.

The client for the current phase gives support to the EIP Service and
the first beta release of Encrypted Mail.
EIP (the Encrypted Internet Proxy) provides circumvention,
location anonymization, and traffic encryption in a hassle-free,
automatically self-configuring fashion.
Encrypted Mail

You can read the user manual and the developer notes online at:

WARNING: This is still a beta release of our services, a lot of
testing and audits are still needed so DO NOT use this for strong
security.


WHAT CAN THIS VERSION OF THE CLIENT DO FOR ME?

You can connect to the EIP service offered by a provider of your
choice, and enjoy a encrypted internet connection.

The first run wizard allows to register an user with the selected
provider, downloading all the config files needed to connect to the
eip service. There are also some minimal network checks in place.
